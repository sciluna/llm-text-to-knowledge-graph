      "text": "There are substantial shortcomings in the drugs currently available for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The global diabetic crisis has not abated despite the introduction of new types of drugs and targets. Persistent unaddressed patient needs remain a significant factor in the quest for new leads in routine studies. Drug discovery methods in this area have followed developments in the market, contributing to a recent rise in the number of molecules. Nevertheless, troubling developments and fresh challenges are still evident. Recently, metformin, the most widely used first-line drug for diabetes, was found to contain a carcinogenic contaminant known as N-nitroso dimethylamine (NDMA). Therefore, purity and toxicity are also a big challenge for drug discovery and development. Moreover, newer drug classes against SGLT-2 illustrate both progress and difficulties. The same was true previously in the case of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Furthermore, researchers must study the importance of mechanistic characteristics of novel compounds, as well as exposure-related hazardous aspects of current and newly identified protein targets, in order to identify new pharmacological molecules with improved selectivity and specificity.",

During times in which there is an inadequate food supply, people in Micronesia consume an excess amount of sugar to sustain themselves. After recovering from such periods, even with an increased availability of higher quality foods, sugar consumption has become an integral part of their daily dietary habits. Micronesian survey data show that around 73.1% of the population is overweight, and 32.1% frankly diabetic.",

      "text": "The heat stress response activates the transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), which subsequently upregulates heat shock proteins to maintain the integrity of the proteome. HSF1 activation requires nuclear localization, trimerization, DNA binding, phosphorylation and gene transactivation. Phosphorylation at S326 is an important regulator of HSF1 transcriptional activity. Phosphorylation at S326 is mediated by AKT1, mTOR, p38, MEK1 and DYRK2. Here, we observed activation of HSF1 by AKT1 independently of mTOR. AKT2 also phosphorylated S326 of HSF1 but showed weak ability to activate HSF1. Similarly, mTOR, p38, MEK1 and DYRK2 all phosphorylated S326 but AKT1 was the most potent activator. Mass spectrometry showed that AKT1 also phosphorylated HSF1 at T142, S230 and T527 in addition to S326, whereas the other kinases did not. Subsequent investigation revealed that phosphorylation at T142 is necessary for HSF1 trimerization and that S230, S326 and T527 are required for HSF1 gene transactivation and recruitment of TFIIB and CDK9. Interestingly, T527 as a phosphorylated residue has not been previously shown and sits in the transactivation domain, further implying a role for this site in HSF1 gene transactivation. This study suggests that HSF1 hyperphosphorylation is targeted and these specific residues have direct function in regulating HSF1 transcriptional activity.",

AKT2 and AKT3 also have pro-tumour functions but whether HSF1 can be regulated by these isoforms remains unknown. To assess this possibility, either AKT1, AKT2 or AKT3 were introduced into multiple cell lines along with a luciferase reporter driven by the presence of two heat shock elements (HSEs). Consistent with our previous findings, AKT1 strongly induced HSF1 activity (Fig. 1A-C). AKT2 promoted a significant increase in HSF1 activity, but the effect was modest while AKT3 had no significant effect on HSF1 activity (Fig. 1A-C). To determine the ability of the AKT isoforms to phosphorylate HSF1 at S326, a key phosphorylation event critical for HSF1 activity, an in vitro kinase assay followed by immunoblotting was performed with each AKT isoform. Both AKT1 and AKT2 phosphorylated S326 of HSF1 at similar levels but AKT3 showed no capability for phosphorylating S326 (Fig. 1D). ",

AKT1 is also a well-known activator of mTOR and mTOR has been shown to phosphorylate HSF1 at S326 in response to proteotoxic stress. Therefore, to determine whether AKT1-driven HSF1 activity and S326 phosphorylation is mediated by mTOR, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of rapamycin and subjected to the HSE luciferase reporter assay or immunoblotting with p-HSF1 S326 antibodies. Results indicated that rapamycin had no effect on HSF1 activity (Fig. 1F) or on S326 phosphorylation (Fig. 1G) driven by AKT1. We further assessed whether the AKT isoforms affected downstream activation steps of HSF1, including trimerization and DNA binding. ",

The mammalian family of sirtuins consists of 7 proteins, SIRT1-7, which are ubiquitously expressed. Three of the sirtuins, SIRT1, SIRT6, and SIRT7 localize to the nucleus, SIRT2 is mainly localized in the cytoplasm, while the remaining three sirtuins: SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5 are found in the mitochondria. The members of the sirtuin family not only differ in cellular locations, but also in enzymatic function. SIRT1 and SIRT5 are primarily protein deacetylases, SIRT4 and SIRT6 are mono(ADP)-ribosyltransferases, and SIRT2 and SIRT3 exhibit both enzymatic activities; no clear functionality has been attributed to SIRT7. The conserved catalytic domain of sirtuins is capable of carrying out both deacetylation and ADP-ribosylation activities using NAD+, and it has been suggested that sirtuins may have the potential to carry out either enzymatic activity under the right conditions. This review will focus on SIRT1 (EC 3.5.1.-) a member of the sirtuin family that is expressed in many tissues and acts as a NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase. SIRT1 has been implicated in signaling pathways underlying various diseases, including: diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, cancer, aging, and obesity.",

For example, A20 suppresses apoptotic JNK signaling in a TNF-dependent and independent manner via induction of ASK1 degradation (Won et al.,). Since A20 is efficiently induced by TNF administration it is tempting to speculate that the loss of ASK1 might shift the cellular response from apoptosis to survival and proliferation. Our data include an additional mechanistic level to this observation. ASK1 can phosphorylate JNK and the physical interaction between A20 and ASK1 has been demonstrated (Tobiume et al.,; Won et al.,). We here showed that TNF affects the interaction between A20 and ASK1, which could explain the ASK1-dependent phosphorylation of JNK at specific periods after TNF administration. The underlying molecular mechanism for this precise and dynamic fine-tune regulation is not understood, however, the natural oscillations observed in the activation dynamics of both JNK and NF-kappaB could be partly explained in terms of synchrony / asynchrony ASK1:A20 dynamics as observed in this study (Ashall et al.,).",

Injection of IgG, which also activates complement, into the paws of rats caused neuropathic pain symptoms. Activation of complement also increased the influx of macrophages. To further test the role of complement activation in pain, rats were injected IP with sCR1 15 minutes prior to partial ligation surgery, and then tested for heat and mechanical sensitivity. Rats injected with sCR1 showed significantly higher pain thresholds than those that were sham injected. These rats also showed less C3 deposition and macrophage influx.

We found that SLAMF1 controls trafficking of the Toll receptor-associated molecule (TRAM) from the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) to Escherichia coli phagosomes. In resting macrophages, SLAMF1 is localized to ERC, but upon addition of E. coli, it is trafficked together with TRAM from ERC to E. coli phagosomes in a Rab11-dependent manner. We found that endogenous SLAMF1 protein interacted with TRAM and defined key interaction domains as amino acids 68 to 95 of TRAM as well as 15 C-terminal amino acids of SLAMF1. Interestingly, the SLAMF1-TRAM interaction was observed for human but not mouse proteins.
