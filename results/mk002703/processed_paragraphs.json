A diagram convention was designed capable of unambiguous representation of networks containing multiprotein complexes, protein modifications, and enzymes that are substrates of other enzymes. To facilitate linkage to a database, each molecular species is symbolically represented only once in each diagram. Molecular species can be located on the map by means of indexed grid coordinates. Each interaction is referenced to an annotation list where pertinent information and references can be found. Parts of the network are grouped into functional subsystems. The map shows how multiprotein complexes could assemble and function at gene promoter sites and at sites of DNA damage. It also portrays the richness of connections between the p53-Mdm2 subsystem and other parts of the network."

Current diagrams of molecular interactions are often ambiguous or incomplete. The preparation of more comprehensive regulatory network diagrams is both difficult and urgent. The difficulties are not due merely to the large number of reactions, because this is a feature also of the familiar metabolic pathway diagrams. They are due rather to complexities that rarely occur in classical pathway diagrams, such as multisubunit complexes, protein modifications, enzymes that are modified by other enzymes, and protein domains whose function is regulated by other domains of the same molecule. The present work describes and applies a diagram method designed to cope with these kinds of complexity."

Accordingly, each molecular species should ideally appear only once in a diagram, and all interactions involving that species should emanate from a single symbolic construct. A second major consideration was a concise method to represent multimolecular complexes. Multimer proteins are common components of regulatory systems and sometimes function in large-scale multimolecular assemblies. Therefore, an extensible representation of such complexes was a fundamental requirement. A third major consideration was the representation of protein modifications, such as phosphorylations. One must be able to represent various modifications of a protein by unique graphical constructs. Meeting these goals simultaneously is a significant challenge."

(The italicized letter\u2013number combinations identify particular interactions in Figure 6 and refer to entries in the annotation list where references are cited.) Because promoters generally have two or more E2F recognition elements, however, the actual situation even in this case may be far from simple. Most E2F family proteins can activate transcription (E6) by way of a transactivation domain. E2F-6, however, has instead a transcription repressor domain (E9). E2F:DP heterodimers (other than those of E2F-6) can tether pRb family proteins onto promoters, thereby converting a potential gene activator into a repressor (E7). E2F in fact more often functions to repress rather than activate. E2F proteins (as heterodimers with a DP protein [E1]) have individual binding preferences for pRb family members. The E2F-pRb box shows that pRb prefers E2F-1-, -2-, or -3-containing heterodimers (E2) (with lesser interaction with E2F-4), p107 binds only E2F-4 heterodimers, and p130 can bind heterodimers of E2F-4 or 5 (E3,4). All of these complexes can bind and repress E2F recognition elements (E6). E2F-6, however, does not bind any pRb family protein. E2F-1, -2, and -3 are marked together as a unit on the map, because of their mutual preference for pRb.

DNA-PK, however, can also bind to RPA (S16). RPA is a heterotrimer (S1,2) that binds ssDNA regions (S3). DNA-PK can thus be recruited to ssDNA regions formed transiently at replication forks. DNA-PK may then be available for interaction with a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) end, which could appear in the vicinity as a consequence of replication fork encounters with open topoisomerase I DNA complexes trapped by drugs such as camptothecin (Shao et al., 1999). It is noteworthy that DNA-PK does not always require Ku for activation, because it can be activated by tethering to DNA via other molecules, such as chromatin constituents of the HMG family (B10)."

        "text": "Biological functions must eventually be understood as arising from molecular interactions. It is therefore not surprising that the molecular interaction information so far accumulated forms a highly complex network whose functional behavior may be difficult to comprehend. To provide a foundation for eventual understanding of function, this information must be organized in a manner that allows integrated behavior to be discerned. Molecular interaction maps such as those described here could contribute to this goal. The primary objective here was to suggest how complex molecular interaction networks can be usefully displayed. The map was constructed from evidence relating to molecular interactions with the view that the interaction patterns would suggest biological functions. The complexity of the map, however, demands that great care be taken in the formulation of specific functional hypotheses, which may have to be investigated with the aid of computer simulations (Kohn, 1998)."

Some of the numerous connections between the boxes can be arranged in tracts, perhaps analogous to nerve tracts in the brain or communication buses in computers. A task for the future is to find an objective way to make these groupings, or indeed to determine to what extent nature has designed subsystems within the control network."

        "text": "The map includes 26 individual p53 modification or binding interactions for which evidence of functionality has been presented. Considering the number of modifications and binding combinations that are possible a priori, the number of different possible states of p53 could be so large as to raise the question of whether, at any given time in a cell, any two p53 molecules would likely be in the same state. It seems plausible, however, that certain combinations of states would be strongly favored under particular circumstances."

        "text": "p53 appears to be a central focus for the concurrence of signals from many pathways, presumably serving as an integrated information processor. It might, for example, function to test the validity of signaling patterns and, depending on the outcome of the test, to initiate cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. The test however must first be activated by allowing p53 (which normally is rapidly degraded and thus nearly absent) to accumulate in response to inputs involving Mdm2 and/or p19ARF. It appears to be a logic unit that monitors the state of the cell based on the pattern of a large number of inputs."

        "text": "The molecular interaction map helps one discern possible multiprotein assemblies, alternative arrangements of which may operate under different circumstances in a cell or under particular states of cell differentiation. A recent example and possible paradigm is the large multiprotein binder and acetyl transferase p300, which may function as a platform for the assembly of high-order complexes (Grossman et al., 1998). Multiprotein interactions may be competitive, cooperative, or independent of each other, possibly depending on the modification states of the component molecules. Moreover, susceptibility to modification may depend on the multimolecular configuration. A given protein may have more than one binding site for a second protein: p300, for example, has two separated sites for binding of p53 (Grossman et al., 1998). Multimolecular complexes thus may have alternative, functionally different configurations, and covalent modifications could induce configurational switches. The details of these interdependencies may be critically important, but only fragmentary information is as yet available."

        "text": "Promoter regulation can be very complicated, because transcription factors can have positive or negative effects, depending on their environments and mutual interactions. Genes controlled in part by the same transcription factors sometimes exhibit different regulation patterns. Moreover, the interactions among the different transcription factors are only beginning to be elucidated. It was therefore not feasible, in the present diagrams, to show the full regulation pattern of each individual gene. The regulation of the E2F-dependent S-phase genes and of the p53-dependent genes highlight the difficulties. The major known regulatory actions on these genes are shown (Figure 6, A and B), and some of the details regarding effects on individual genes are mentioned in the annotation list."

These \u201cheuristic\u201d diagrams do not fully define the contingencies among the interactions. For simulation of models, however, \u201cexplicit\u201d or fully defined diagrams are needed. Suitable explicit diagrams can be prepared using a subset of the present symbols (Kohn, 1998) or using the conventions of electronic circuitry (McAdams and Shapiro, 1995)."

Many of the known interactions relating to cell cycle control and DNA repair events in the nucleus were included in the map. Some important areas remain to be added: in particular, the control of nuclear\u2013cytoplasmic shuttling of key regulatory molecules and the signaling pathways from growth factor receptors on the cell surface. The molecular interaction map will require frequent updating as new information accrues. For this purpose, we plan to put updated versions the map on the Internet (http://discover.nci.nih.gov)"
