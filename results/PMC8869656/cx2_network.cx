The first reference to diabetes was in 1550 B.C. in an Egyptian papyrus, where it was described as a rare disease characterized by excessive weight loss and frequent urination. The term diabetes (to siphon or to pass through, in Greek) was first used by Apollonius of Memphis, who noted that patients with diabetes present with frequent urination. A Greek physician, Galen, hypothesized it to be a type of kidney disease, as the most prominent symptom was glucosuria. Avicenna (980-1037) offered a comprehensive description of diabetes mellitus in his publication \"The Canon of Medicine\" in 1025. Eventually, owing to its characteristic symptoms, many tests to more fully identify the disease were developed in the late 11th century, involving the examination of the subject's urine's color, odor and taste. The sweet taste of a diabetic patient's urine apparently led to its second name, mellitus (honey, in Latin). Later in the 19th century, Matthew Dobson discovered that the excessive amount of sugar in the urine of patients with diabetes gives it that sweet taste. He also provided an important distinction between the two different types of diabetes, which are now referred to as type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Banting and Macleod observed a reduction in blood glucose levels after administering islets of Langerhans to a pancreatectomized dog, and for this breakthrough discovery they were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1923.

SU have shown good efficacy in reducing glycated hemoglobin microvasculature complications in patients with T2DM. However, their major drawback is prolonged binding time to the beta-cells, which results in prolonged insulin release. The non-sulfonylureas also stimulate beta-cells to secrete insulin, but they are short acting. In 2004, Jean-Claude Henquin proposed five potential action sites for insulin secretagogue beta-cell metabolism activation: increased blocking of beta-cell KATP channels; increase in intracellular (Ca2+) concentration by means other than KATP channels; activation of various amplifying pathways in beta-cells; action on beta-cell membrane receptors; and action on beta-cell nuclear receptors.",

                    "evidence": "The free fatty acids (FFAs) can act as signaling molecules. FFAs are generally divided into three sub-categories based on their chain length as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) and long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). FFAs of these varying chain lengths are known to activate transmembrane receptors such as FFA1, FFA2, and FFA3. For example, FFA1 are expressed to a large extent on the pancreatic beta-cells and are activated by LCFAs. The activation of these receptors also plays an important role in the increase of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Therefore, because of its obvious role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, a series of FFA1 ligands have been identified and tested. FFA2 and FFA3 are akin to FFA1 receptors and get activated by SCFAs but their role in insulin is complex. FFA2 receptors are highly expressed in immune cells, especially neutrophils. Studies have also identified FFA2 expression on murine pancreatic beta-cell line MIN6 and isolated mouse islets. The indirect support for the role of FFA2 in diabetes comes from the fact that a fiber-rich diet is linked with a lower incidence of diabetes and SCFAs. Ligands for FFA2 are known to be produced by intestinal bacteria in the body by the fermentation of dietary fibers. Tang et al. showed FFA2 and FFA3 expression on human pancreatic beta-cells. These receptors are shown to inhibit insulin secretion by coupling to Gi-type G proteins. They also demonstrated that genetic deletion of FFA2 and FFA3 receptors in pancreatic beta-cells leads to higher insulin secretion in HFD animals, whereas similar deletion in intestinal cells did not affect glucose tolerance in diabetic animals. This study demonstrated that FFA2/FFA3 antagonists may prove beneficial in T2DM.",

                    "evidence": "The free fatty acids (FFAs) can act as signaling molecules. FFAs are generally divided into three sub-categories based on their chain length as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) and long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). FFAs of these varying chain lengths are known to activate transmembrane receptors such as FFA1, FFA2, and FFA3. For example, FFA1 are expressed to a large extent on the pancreatic beta-cells and are activated by LCFAs. The activation of these receptors also plays an important role in the increase of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Therefore, because of its obvious role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, a series of FFA1 ligands have been identified and tested. FFA2 and FFA3 are akin to FFA1 receptors and get activated by SCFAs but their role in insulin is complex. FFA2 receptors are highly expressed in immune cells, especially neutrophils. Studies have also identified FFA2 expression on murine pancreatic beta-cell line MIN6 and isolated mouse islets. The indirect support for the role of FFA2 in diabetes comes from the fact that a fiber-rich diet is linked with a lower incidence of diabetes and SCFAs. Ligands for FFA2 are known to be produced by intestinal bacteria in the body by the fermentation of dietary fibers. Tang et al. showed FFA2 and FFA3 expression on human pancreatic beta-cells. These receptors are shown to inhibit insulin secretion by coupling to Gi-type G proteins. They also demonstrated that genetic deletion of FFA2 and FFA3 receptors in pancreatic beta-cells leads to higher insulin secretion in HFD animals, whereas similar deletion in intestinal cells did not affect glucose tolerance in diabetic animals. This study demonstrated that FFA2/FFA3 antagonists may prove beneficial in T2DM.",

In this way, targets of sub-atomic pathways conceivably involved in both diabetes and CVD are particularly attractive. Such methodologies incorporate the focusing of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1), GPR119, TGR5, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), the sodium-glucose co-carrier 2 (SGLT2), and GPR40, for every one of which the reasoning is briefly depicted below (Table 3).",

The first reference to diabetes was in 1550 B.C. in an Egyptian papyrus, where it was described as a rare disease characterized by excessive weight loss and frequent urination. The term diabetes (to siphon or to pass through, in Greek) was first used by Apollonius of Memphis, who noted that patients with diabetes present with frequent urination. A Greek physician, Galen, hypothesized it to be a type of kidney disease, as the most prominent symptom was glucosuria. Avicenna (980-1037) offered a comprehensive description of diabetes mellitus in his publication \"The Canon of Medicine\" in 1025. Eventually, owing to its characteristic symptoms, many tests to more fully identify the disease were developed in the late 11th century, involving the examination of the subject's urine's color, odor and taste. The sweet taste of a diabetic patient's urine apparently led to its second name, mellitus (honey, in Latin). Later in the 19th century, Matthew Dobson discovered that the excessive amount of sugar in the urine of patients with diabetes gives it that sweet taste. He also provided an important distinction between the two different types of diabetes, which are now referred to as type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Banting and Macleod observed a reduction in blood glucose levels after administering islets of Langerhans to a pancreatectomized dog, and for this breakthrough discovery they were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1923. Eli Lilly acquired the first deal to produce insulin on a commercial level. Gradually, by the late 20th century, as the mechanisms behind diabetes started to unfold, various insulin preparations and other oral hypoglycemic drugs paved their way onto the market.",

                    "evidence": "T2DM is the most common type of diabetes. It is a chronic and multifactorial disease. Earlier this was also called Non-insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM), but this term is no longer used because insulin is often used in the management of NIDDM. T2DM is believed to be caused by the gradual development of cells resistant towards insulin and beta-cell dysfunction, although the exact mechanism remains unclear. Being overweight or obese is a major risk factor for T2DM, as it may increase the likelihood of insulin resistance. This in turn will decrease uptake of glucose in, for example, the heart or musculoskeletal tissues, with simultaneous increase in glucose production in organs such as the liver. To counter this, insulin secretion is enhanced by beta-cells. Therefore, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia often coexist during early T2DM. In later stages of the disease, beta-cell function is also diminished. Thus, therapeutics that target beta-cell functioning and decrease insulin resistance are key treatments in T2DM. Some of the factors that control beta-cell functioning include oxidative stress, ER-stress and autophagy. Over the years, researchers have worked on various targets to moderate the onset or worsening of diabetes in their patients, out of which many turned into drug targets.",

SU have shown good efficacy in reducing glycated hemoglobin microvasculature complications in patients with T2DM.

The non-sulfonylureas also stimulate beta-cells to secrete insulin, but they are short acting. In 2004, Jean-Claude Henquin proposed five potential action sites for insulin secretagogue beta-cell metabolism activation: increased blocking of beta-cell KATP channels; increase in intracellular (Ca2+) concentration by means other than KATP channels; activation of various amplifying pathways in beta-cells; action on beta-cell membrane receptors; and action on beta-cell nuclear receptors.",

FFA2 and FFA3 are akin to FFA1 receptors and get activated by SCFAs but their role in insulin is complex. FFA2 receptors are highly expressed in immune cells, especially neutrophils. Studies have also identified FFA2 expression on murine pancreatic beta-cell line MIN6 and isolated mouse islets. The indirect support for the role of FFA2 in diabetes comes from the fact that a fiber-rich diet is linked with a lower incidence of diabetes and SCFAs. Ligands for FFA2 are known to be produced by intestinal bacteria in the body by the fermentation of dietary fibers. Tang et al. showed FFA2 and FFA3 expression on human pancreatic beta-cells. These receptors are shown to inhibit insulin secretion by coupling to Gi-type G proteins. They also demonstrated that genetic deletion of FFA2 and FFA3 receptors in pancreatic beta-cells leads to higher insulin secretion in HFD animals, whereas similar deletion in intestinal cells did not affect glucose tolerance in diabetic animals. This study demonstrated that FFA2/FFA3 antagonists may prove beneficial in T2DM.",
